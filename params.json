{"name":"Erdiko","tagline":"The Open Source Middleware Framework","body":"Erdiko\r\n=======\r\n\r\n**Enterprise Glue**\r\n\r\nErdiko is a contextual middleware framework or better yet, an enterprise Mash-Up framework.\r\n\r\nVersion (SemVer)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n0.6.4\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nClone erdiko from github and set up an apache vhost to the webroot.\r\n\r\nWebroot is located at /www/public/\r\n\r\nTheme/view files go in the /www/public folder while application code goes in the /www/app/ folder.  Do not modify files outside of app and public folder if you want to maintain an easy upgrade path with Erdiko.\r\n\r\nVision\r\n------\r\n\r\nThis software is a clean middleware framework, hence the name Erdiko which means middle in the Basque language (Euskara).  Our goal is to offer a lightweight framework to create sites optimized for mobile devices, APIs and multiple browsers.\r\n\r\nThe framework seeks to make custom app development and leveraging multiple open source projects an easier task.  If you need to mash-up multiple applications/frameworks like Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and Zend into a unified application then give Erdiko a shot.  If you want a clean, light weight framework you have also come to the right place.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe code is a work in progress, and although stable, may contain items that need more refinement.  It is a functional Alpha codebase that will be post Beta later this year.  There are various production sites currently using this software yet it is best to consider it pre-beta, so be sure you know what your doing before you use it in a production environment.\r\n\r\nWe value feedback and would love to hear your thoughts about the architecture and ease of use of this framework.  There are a lot of possibilities for Erdiko, we value your ideas and thoughts about where to take this codebase.\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Author**\r\n\r\n\tJohn Arroyo - Architect, Lead Back-End / Integration engineer\r\n\r\n**Contributors**\r\n\r\n\t* Varun Brahme - Back-End development and unit testing\r\n\t* Dave LaFLam - Front-End development (default theme)\r\n\r\n* If you want to help, please do, we'd love more code!
