Erdiko
=======

**Enterprise Glue**

Erdiko is an MVC micro framework or better yet, an enterprise Mash-Up framework.

Version (SemVer)
----------------

0.8.4

Installation
------------

***via composer***

at the commandline run,

	composer create-project erdiko/erdiko

***via git & composer***

Clone erdiko from github and run "composer install" in the root folder /

1. git clone git@github.com:ArroyoLabs/erdiko.git
2. cd erdiko
3. composer install

***Server***

Now that you have the latest code, set up an apache vhost to the webroot which is located at /public/

In general, downloadable files go in the /public folder while application code goes in the /app/ folder.  Erdiko core code is in the /vendor/erdiko/ folder.

Vision
------

Erdiko wants to make your php development easier. If you need a lightweight MVC framework then this is the tool for you. Our goal is to offer a clean platform to create sites optimized for mobile devices, APIs and multiple browsers.

Erdiko can act as a mash-up or middleware framework, hence the name 'Erdiko' which means 'middle' in the Basque language (Euskara). Use Erdiko if you need to mash-up multiple applications/frameworks like Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and Zend into a unified application.

Notes
-----

We value feedback and would love to hear your thoughts about the architecture and ease of use of this framework.  There are a lot of possibilities for Erdiko, we value your ideas and thoughts about where to take this codebase.
