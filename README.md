The Contextual Middleware Framework

or 

The Enterprise Mash-Up Framework

Semver

0.5.1

Goal
----

Our goal is to offer a lightweight framework to make your sites optimized for mobile devices, APIs and multiple browsers.  Erdiko means middle in the Basque language (Euskara).  The framework aims to make custom app development and leveraging multiple open source projects easy.  If you need to leverage multiple projects like Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and Zend into a unified application then give Erdiko a shot.

The code is in a preliminary architecture stage.  It is functional yet not in Alpha and should not be used for production installations unless you really know what you're doing.
