          <h2> Discover </h2 > 
            <p> The framework seeks to make custom app development and leveraging multiple open source projects an easier task. If you need to mash-up multiple applications/frameworks like Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and Zend into a unified application then give Erdiko a shot. If you want a clean, light weight framework you have also come to the right place. </p >

          <h2> Feature </h2 > 
            <p > This software is a clean middleware framework, hence the name Erdiko which means middle in the Basque language (Euskara). Our goal is to offer a lightweight framework to create sites optimized for mobile devices, APIs and multiple browsers. </p >
