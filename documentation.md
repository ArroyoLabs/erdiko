## Routes

This software is a clean middleware framework, hence the name Erdiko which means middle in the Basque language (Euskara). Our goal is to offer a lightweight framework to create sites optimized for mobile devices, APIs and multiple browsers.

The framework seeks to make custom app development and leveraging multiple open source projects an easier task. If you need to mash-up multiple applications/frameworks like Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and Zend into a unified application then give Erdiko a shot. If you want a clean, light weight framework you have also come to the right place.

## Note

The code is a work in progress, and although stable, may contain items that need more refinement. It is a functional Alpha codebase that will be post Beta later this year. There are various production sites currently using this software yet it is best to consider it pre-beta, so be sure you know what your doing before you use it in a production environment.

We value feedback and would love to hear your thoughts about the architecture and ease of use of this framework. There are a lot of possibilities for Erdiko, we value your ideas and thoughts about where to take this codebase.
